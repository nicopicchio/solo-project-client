# Project Description
This project was inspired by the John Wick movies.  
In the movies, the Continental is a chain of hotels located all around the world that function as a neutral territory for members of the criminal underworld, generally hitmen and high-end criminals.

- You can find out more about the Continental [here](https://johnwick.fandom.com/wiki/Continental_Hotel).

The app simulates a booking system where users can carry out contracts by choosing jobs from the list of jobs available. The jobs come from real unsolved FBI cases that are shared by the FBI itself through their public API.

- You can get to the FBI public API docs [here](https://api.fbi.gov/docs).
